APIRead the Docs Public API
=========================

We have a limited public API that is available for you to get data out of the site. 
This document covers only part of the API provided. We have plans to create a read/write API, so that you can easily automate interactions with your project.

.. warning:: This API is out of date and not currently maintained.
             We have a v2 API that is currently supported at http://readthedocs.org/api/v2/.
